Original `readme.md` from the repository could not be read by the editor in this environment (it appeared to be binary or encoded in an unsupported format).

This file is a placeholder backup indicating the original README was preserved on disk. If you need a bit-for-bit copy of the original, please back up `readme.md` manually outside of this editor environment.

Filename: readme.md (original)
Reason: binary/unreadable in editor

If you want me to attempt a byte-for-byte copy into this workspace (base64 or hex), tell me and I will try to read the file in binary and write an encoded backup here.
